# README Generator

## Description

This application is a README generator. With the use of node.js and code terminal, the user is given prompts that they must give answers to in order to generate a produce a readme file that meets professional quality.

##  Future Development

In future development of this application I would like to add the option to add more then one screenshot as well as the option to add repository link and deployed application links if necessary.

##  Usage 

The application will need to be accessed through the use of node.js to generate your README file. The new README file will be output into the directory titled 'dist' within the codes directory.

## Installation

You must download the application code from the repository and clone it to your local machine.
After the code has been cloned to your machine, you can then type 'npm install' in the directory 
of that repository to have access to the dependencies for this application to work.
